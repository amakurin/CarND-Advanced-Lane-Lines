# **Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in file calibration.py (lines 34 to 59).  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to one of calibrations images using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained these results: 

![Undistorted Chess][undistortedChess]

I precalculated camera matrix and distortion coefficients once and saved them to file. Later i load this data before video or single frame processing.

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

For distortion correction i used cv2.undistort() function with previously calculated camera parameters (lines 24 to 32 of file labutils.py) 

Here is example of applying distortion correction:

![Undistorted Sample][undistortedSample]


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I used a combination of fixed range color threshoding, with adaptive thresholding of value and saturation channels of image in HSV color space.

Core idea of my adaptive thresholding routine, is analysis of trapezoidal region of interest (ROI) which is mainly contains pixels corresponding to road surface. 
Most of these pixels with lower intensity are corresponding to pavement, and few of them corresponding to marking and usually have higher intensity.
I build histogram of intencity of this ROI, and find first valley after maximum peak.
This can be done in many ways, i implemented two and chose one of them that performed better for project video. The code of intencity thresholding is contained in file main.py, lines 12 to 66.

Applying this routine to V and S channel of HSV converted image i got two masks. 
I got another two for white and yellow colors: for white color i used RGB range [180,180,180]-[255,255,255], for yellow color i used range 15-25 on hue channel.
Then i took conjunction of V mask with white mask, and S mask with yellow mask, and disjunction of results.
I didn't use gradient thresholding because it gave no additional information on project video, but additional noise.
The code of whole thresholding step is contained in file main.py, lines 68 to 93.

Here are examples of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)

![thresholding1][thresholding1]
![thresholding2][thresholding2]

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

I used single pair of direct and inverse perspective transformation matrices for whole video. 
I precalculated this matrices once and save them in a file to later use similary as for calibration parameters (lines 14 to 19 of file perspective.py). 
For this step i used one undistorted frame with straight lines from the project video. I chose centered trapezoid points as source points of transformation, and centered rectangle points as destination point.
I chose size of trapezoid such that perspective transform turns lane lines of frame to roughly parallel vertical lines.
I chose size of destination rectangle such that proportions in x and y directions were somewhat close to real, to decrease errors in calculations.
This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
|  561, 470     | 320, 144      | 
|  719, 470     | 960, 144      |
| 1062, 690     | 960, 719      |
|  218, 690     | 320, 719      |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the source trapezoid onto a test image and its warped counterpart with destination rectangle to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.
Here is source trapezoid drawn with red color, and target rectangle drawn with cyan.

Here are examples of perspective transformation applied to thresholded images from previus step:
![perspective1][perspective1]
![perspective2][perspective2]


#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![fit1][fit1]
![fit2][fit2]

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

![result1][result1]
![result2][result2]

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_result.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
